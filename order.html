        screams productivity like scrolling through your phone for hours while convincing yourself
        it's 'research.' And who needs sleep when you can stare at the ceiling, rethinking every
        awkward thing you've ever said? But hey, at least you’ve mastered the fine art of
        procrastination. Congratulations, you’re officially the CEO of avoiding tasks until the very
        last possible second. A true talent, really!"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It
        is the courage to continue that counts." – Winston Churchill "The only limit to our
        realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today." – Franklin D. Roosevelt "Your time is
        limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life." – Steve Jobs""Success is not final,
        failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts." – Winston Churchill "The
        only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today." – Franklin D. Roosevelt
        "Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life." – Steve Jobs"Success
        is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts." – Winston
